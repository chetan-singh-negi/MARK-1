        Decision control statements 
    </h2> 
    <ul>
        <b>There are 5 types of decision control statements in C </b>
        <li>If </li>
        <li>If-else</li>
        <li>Nested If-else</li>
        <li>Operators</li>
    </ul>
     
    <p> 
        <u><b>If statement : </b></u> If statement is most simplest decision control statement, when the condition given in 
        the statement is true then the following block(s) of statement   
        will be executed and an output will be generated.
        if the condition turns out to be false then the staements out of the if block will be executed afterwards.
        <p> Keep in mind that if we have not given any curly braces "{ }" after writing the " if ( ) "then only one following statement after the "if block" will be considered as part of the if block and will be executed , in simple words if there's only one statement in your if block then the if block will work fine without the curly braces.
        </p>

        <u><b>Syntax: </b></u>
       <blockquote>>  If("Condition")</blockquote>
        <blockquote>{</blockquote>
        <blockquote>  " block of statement(s) "</blockquote> 
        }
    </p>

     take care of this syntax part "mein sochra hu ki isme properlyt syntax likhdu but ye identation dhng se nahi kar paara hu check this out ">
    <p> 
        <u><b>If-else statement : </b></u> Some of you readers might have guessed about the working of this decision control statement and some of you might have not,
        Okay so let's understand it correctly, when we are using if statement the block of statement(s) is executed when condition turns out to be true and if the condition is not true it will not execute the block.
        But what if we want to execute some other statement(s) , that's where If-Else staement comes to play.
        In If-else statement there are two blocks "If" and "Else" , "If" block is executed when the condition is true and when condition turns out to be false then the "Else" block is executed.
