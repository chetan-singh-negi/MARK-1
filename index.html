            An array is defined as the collection of similar type of data items stored at contiguous memory locations. Arrays are the derived data type in C programming language which can store the primitive type of data such as int, char, double, float, etc. It also has the capability to store the collection of derived data types, such as pointers, structure, etc. The array is the simplest data structure where each data element can be randomly accessed by using its index number.

            <p>Array has following properties </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each element of an array is of same data type and carries the same size, i.e., int = 4 bytes.</li>
                <li>Elements of the array are stored at contiguous memory locations where the first element is stored at the smallest memory location.</li>
                <li>
                    Elements of the array can be randomly accessed since we can calculate the address of each element of the array with the given base address and the size of the data element.
